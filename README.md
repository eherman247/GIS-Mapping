# Development Environment

I used an ArcGIS API for this project. It is a standard development API and has limited use. 

I used Javascript for this project. It is all in one HTML file, but can easily be serperated.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* There is a lot of redundant code. This is just the first part and I wanted to get everything on the map.
* I would like to add a JSON file with all of the statistics so it will be easier to call.
* I will add a legend to the map so what each color means will be understandable.
